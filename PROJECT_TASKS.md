# Project Tickets

## 1. Clean Dataset & Conduct Descriptive Analysis
**Goal:** Prepare the data for modeling and gain initial insights into its characteristics.  

### Sub-tasks
- [ ] Perform data transformations and feature engineering as needed
- [ ] Generate descriptive statistics for all variables
- [ ] Create visualizations (plots) to explore variable distributions and relationships

---

## 2. Create Statistical Models
**Goal:** Build explanatory statistical models to understand the drivers of annual net savings.  

### Sub-tasks
- [ ] Train the statistical model(s)
- [ ] Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., R-squared, p-values)
- [ ] Interpret model coefficients and assess statistical significance

---

## 3. Create ML Models
**Goal:** Build predictive machine learning models for annual net savings, incorporating safeguards against overfitting and considering ethical implications.  

### Sub-tasks
- [ ] Train the ML models and evaluate performance using predictive metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
- [ ] Identify and analyze ethical concerns related to predictor variables
- [ ] Explore and potentially implement fairness mitigation techniques

---

## 4. Discuss and Document Results Findings
**Goal:** Synthesize the findings from both statistical and machine learning models, compare their performance and ethical implications, and draw conclusions.  

### Sub-tasks
- [ ] Compare the results and insights from the statistical and ML models
- [ ] Analyze the trade-offs between model performance and select the final model with justification
- [ ] Address any remaining ethical considerations or suspicious results

---

## 5. Write Tests and Deploy Best Model
**Goal:** Prepare the selected model for potential deployment by writing tests and outlining deployment considerations.  

### Sub-tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests or integration tests for the selected model's prediction function
- [ ] Outline a potential deployment strategy (e.g., API endpoint, batch processing)
- [ ] Consider monitoring and maintenance requirements for the deployed model

---

## 6. Prototype an Application with GenAI (Optional Bonus)
**Goal:** Explore the use of Generative AI with a sample of the data (if attempting the optional bonus).  

### Sub-tasks
- [ ] Select and parse a sample of the data into a format suitable for an LLM
- [ ] Use chosen tools (HuggingFace, OpenAI, etc.) to interact with an LLM using the data sample
- [ ] Explore potential applications or insights gained from the LLM interaction
