        "# **Introduction**\n",
        "Actionable insights into customer savings behavior are crucial for driving business growth and improving organisation's relationship with customer. The analysis in this report uses different Statistical and Machine Learning models to identify key patterns in historic saving behaviours for predicting future amounts that customers might save up. More importantly, the analysis identified multiple sensitive variables including protected characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity) and socioeconomic factors (income, credit score, savings). The most concerning pattern is age-based unfairness. A demo prototype showcasing how generative AI can be applied to produce personalized counterfactual savings analysis and actionable financial recommendations is also included in the report."

        "Task 1 focused on data cleaning and descriptive analysis. Upon loading, the dataset contained 30305 records and 15 columns. Initial exploration revealed missing values in `other_income` (13.98%) and `housing_spend` (24.27%), which were imputed for columns with less than 5% missingness. No duplicate rows were found. Outliers in numeric columns were capped at the 1.5*IQR bounds, affecting 5624 values. An `age_group` feature was engineered. The final cleaned data has a shape of (30305, 16), with some remaining missing values.\n",

Ethical concerns should also be an ongoing discussion with domain experts such as lawyers, data protection officers etc."

            "The scenarios that provide the greatest savings improvement are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Increase Salary by 10%** and **20%**: Both scenarios yield an increase of £67.82 (+0.2%). While the percentage increase in savings is minimal, it is the most impactful action available based on the scenarios provided.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Increase Other Income by 50%**: This scenario results in a predicted savings increase of £24.89 (+0.1%). While it is less impactful than the salary increase, it still contributes positively to overall savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reason these actions are impactful is that they directly increase the income, which has a more significant effect on the savings prediction compared to reductions in spending that yield no change or negative impacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Feasibility Assessment\n",
            "The most realistic changes for this customer to implement are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Increase Salary by 10% or 20%**: If the customer is in a position to negotiate a raise or seek a higher-paying job, this could be feasible, especially given their age and experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Increase Other Income by 50%**: This could be achievable through side jobs, freelance work, or investments, depending on the customer’s skills and resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Eliminate Gambling Spend**: Since the customer currently has no gambling spend, this scenario is not applicable.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Reduce Childcare Spend by 30%**: This is also not applicable as there are no childcare expenses.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Reduce Housing Spend by 20% or 50%**: This may be challenging as it often involves moving or renegotiating leases, which can be disruptive.\n",

        "Large language models generally underperform when used to process structured/table data. Instead, I have tapped into it's strength as a text generator to create a scenario based counterfactual analysis. The scenarios explored in the counterfactual analysis, while illustrative and \"made up\" for the purpose of demonstrating the concept, are valuable for exploring potential impacts on savings. By creating these hypothetical situations, we can gain insights into which factors are most sensitive to change and use an LLM to generate personalized and human readable recommendations. This approach allows us to provide customers with concrete examples of how changes in their financial behavior or circumstances could affect their savings goals."

        "This assignment evaluates technical competencies in coding, data analytics and operationalising ethics; however, these capabilities must be understood within their broader business context.\n",
        "Effective ethical ML implementation requires clear alignment with defined business goals to demonstrate tangible value and practical applicability. Drawing from Lloyds Banking Group's 2025-26 strategic priorities, the following business objectives are relevant contexts for this savings prediction exercise:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Deepening customer relationships through behavioral insights – Predictive models can identify high-propensity savers and inform targeted engagement strategies to increase depth of relationship (current: c.1% growth in H1 2025; 2026 target: c.3%) [page 6].\n",
        "2. Optimizing deposit franchise economics – Understanding drivers of savings behavior supports pricing strategies and customer segmentation to improve deposit gross margins (H1 2025: 1.29%, up 16bps YoY) [page 16].\n",
        "3. Supporting sustainable financing commitments – Identifying customers with capacity and propensity to save can inform targeting for green savings products aligned with the £30bn sustainable financing target by 2026 [page 6].\n",
        "4. Enhancing capital-lite revenue growth – Predictive insights into savings patterns can support fee-based product cross-sell, contributing to the 50:50 NII:OOI revenue split target and >£1.5bn additional strategic revenues by 2026 [page 7].\n",
        "5. Driving operational efficiency through automation – ML models can automate customer segmentation and propensity scoring, supporting the <50% cost-to-income ratio target and productivity improvements (>40% increase in customers served per FTE vs. 2021) [page 7,9,19].\n",
        "6. Risk-aware portfolio management – Understanding the financial health indicators within savings behavior supports prudent lending decisions and maintaining robust asset quality (target AQR: c.25bps) [page 20]."
